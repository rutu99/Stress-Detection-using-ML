# Stress-Detection-using-ML
 "A machine learning project to detect stress in social media posts using NLP techniques."

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies in text data.
Normalize text by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze word frequency to identify stress-related terms.
Explore post timestamps to study trends in stress-related posts.
Feature Engineering:

Extract features such as text length, engagement metrics, and sentiment scores.
Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models to label posts as stressed or non-stressed.
Model Building (Optional):

Build machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks) for stress detection based on text features.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Data Visualization:

Create plots to visualize stress trends over time and the impact of engagement on user stress.
Key Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK, SpaCy, or Transformers
Modeling Libraries (Optional): Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Expected Outcomes:
A dataset labeled with stress indicators derived from social media posts.
Insights into the language patterns associated with stress.
Visualizations depicting stress trends and patterns over time.
(Optional) A predictive model capable of detecting stress levels from social media text.
